# Project-Maze
Overview:

This Python project implements a maze-solving algorithm using a depth-first search approach. It includes a maze class and a frontier class for exploring and finding a solution path from the start to the goal.

Usage

The script initializes a maze from a file and finds a solution path from the start (A) to the goal (B). The solution path is marked with asterisks (*).

Maze Representation A: Start point B: Goal point (space): Open path #: Wall

Algorithm The algorithm uses a depth-first search approach to explore possible paths in the maze until it finds a solution from the start to the goal.
